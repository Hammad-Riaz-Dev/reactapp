<h1>Words Counter Application - React</h1>

Welcome to my first React app! This is a simple **Words Counter** application that counts the number of words and characters you enter into a text box. It's designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and built entirely with React.

## Features
- Count the number of words typed in the input box.
- Count the total number of characters (excluding spaces).
- Real-time word and character count as you type.

## Live Demo
